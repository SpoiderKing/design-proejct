        A demigod is a minor deity, usually male, who is the offspring of a human and a deity, while the phrase can also refer to a mortal who has been elevated to a minor deity after death, or a lesser minor deity having two divine parents. Demigods have powers and talents that are greater than those of a human, but not as great as those of a true deity.
        Demigods are most famously associated with Greek mythology, but comparable concepts can be found in myths all across the world. Demigods were legendary heroes or fictitious kings in Greek mythology who Greek monarchs claimed lineage from in order to legitimise their rule.

        Despite his reputation as a champion of the downtrodden and a powerful protector in Roman mythology, Hercules' personal issues began at birth. Juno dispatched two witches to prevent the birth, but one of Alcmene's slaves fooled them and escorted them to another room. Juno dispatched serpents to assassinate him in his cradle, but Hercules strangled both of them. According to one version of the myth, Alcmene left her infant in the woods to protect him from Juno's wrath, but he was discovered by the goddess Minerva, who brought him to Juno, claiming he was an orphan kid who needed feeding. Juno breastfed Hercules until he bit her nipple, at which time she pushed him away.
