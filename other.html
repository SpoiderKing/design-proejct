            The Ancient Greeks believed that in the beginning, the world was in a state of nothingness which they called Chaos. Suddenly, from light, came Gaia (Mother Earth) and from her came Uranus (the sky) along with other old gods (called primordials) like Pontus (the primordial god of the oceans). Gaia and Uranus had 12 children, the Titans. The most important of the 12 children were Kronos and Rhea.

            Gaia gave birth to monsters called cyclops and monsters called the hundred handed ones. Uranus, disgusted by the monsters, threw them in Tartarus. Gaia was angered by Uranus and sought revenge on him. Gaia used her son Kronos, who chopped off Uranus' genitals. Kronos then threw Uranus into the ocean. From the blood of his genitals, came the goddess of love and beautyâ€”Aphrodite.
            
            Kronos married his sister Rhea and gave birth to 6 children, who were called the gods. Kronos, who was afraid of a prophecy delivered to him which stated that one day his children would cut him up, swallowed each of his children the second they were born. Rhea did not like this, so she saved Zeus and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. Zeus was raised by Amaltheia. In some versions of the story, Amaltheia was a nymph. In other versions she was a goat. Zeus grew up in a mountain cave in Crete. When he was old enough, he tricked Kronos into drinking a mixture of wine and mustard with the help of Metis, whom later had a child with Zeus named Athena. Kronos vomited up the rest of the gods, who, being immortal, had been growing up completely undigested in Kronos' stomach. Zeus and other gods then waged war against the Titans. Zeus won with the help of the hundred handed ones and the cyclops. After they won the war Zeus cut Kronos into pieces and threw them into Tartarus.
            
            Zeus was, from then on, the leader of the gods; Poseidon took over the oceans and Hades took over the Underworld. Zeus married his sister Hera and crowned her Queen of Olympus.
