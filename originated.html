    <h1>Where The Mythology Came From</h1>

        Greek mythology is a kind of Ancient Greek folklore that consists of myths first told by the Greeks. The origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' own cult and ceremonial practises, as well as the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological animals, are all explored in these stories. Modern scholars examine myths to gain a better understanding of ancient Greece's religious and political structures, as well as the nature of myth-making itself.Beginning in the 18th century BC, Greek myths were spread through an oral-poetic legacy, most likely by Minoan and Mycenaean singers; later, the myths of the heroes of the Trojan War and its aftermath formed part of the oral heritage of Homer's epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey. The Theogony and the Works and Days, two works by Homer's near contemporary Hesiod, describe the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human sufferings, and the origin of sacrificial customs.Myths can also be found in the Homeric Hymns, fragments of Epic Cycle epic poems, lyric poems, the works of fifth-century BC tragedians and comedians, writings of Hellenistic Age intellectuals and poets, and texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias.
